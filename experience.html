                <h2>Experience a New Place</h2>
                <p>Experience a New Place is a one minute narrative designed to show the importance of travel. In 2018 I had an experience of a life time travelling to the Middle East. On this trip I learnt so much about other cultures and felt I had a deeper understanding of the world outside New Zealand. This is what inspired me to create a motion piece on travel. When we travel we are exposed to different cultures, locations, history, food and music. This allows us to gain a deeper understanding of other cultures. As a result we are more empathetic towards one another.
                    <p>
                        In this story we follow an individual caught up in his own bubble. He goes on a journey, travelling through different locations and by the end of it he has a better appreciation for the world around him. I was assigned the art movement Bauhaus for inspiration. I combined a geometric design with a casual illsutration style. My aim here was to create a carefree travel mood with the illustration and use vibrant colour and the geometric Bauhaus shapes to bring the scene to life.  
                        <p>
                            This project was recognised by Media Design School and in association with Auckland Live was played in a reel of student work on the Digital Stage in Aotea Square early 2019.
