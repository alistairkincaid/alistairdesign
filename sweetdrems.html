                <h2>Sweet D<em>REM</em>s</h2>
                <p>I started this project to explore REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and better understand its role on idea generation, communicated though a motion context. The project quickly became a methodology driven exploration into my own dreams during REM sleep over a 10 day period. I would recreate dream tests I had found by researchers and scientists in the field, such as Robert Stickgold&apos;s tetris experiment to see if actions before sleep can influence what I dream about. I would also practice healthly sleep and reading before bed. Each morning I would record my dreams and illustrate them in my personal style.
                    <p>
                        After 10 days of this process I was successful in developing new ideas from my own REM sleep, however what really stood out to me was the overall benefit of interpreting and reflecting on my dreams. I found that interpreting my dreams gave me insight into making better decisions and improving my own well being.
                        <p>
                            In order to gather insights from dreams, you must keep an eye out while your eyes are rapidly moving.
                            <p>
                                When turning this research into a motion peice I was excited to show the journey I had been on, I kept developing narratives that were fairly orthodox. As I originally had an experimental approach to this project it made sense to create an experimental animation. I animated the illustrated recording of my dreams. The final exhibition of this project was at Media Design School. I set up an area with bean bags and used projection mapping to display my work underneath a staircase to create the context of sleep.
                                <p>
                                    Since the exhibition of this work at Media Design School, I developed the animated imagery and tested the project at a house party. This is a different context from sleep and was to test the functionality of this project in a party atmosphere and its relationship with the blaring Drum and Bass music. I aim to continue developing this project for more related events (continue projecting cool stuff for people).
