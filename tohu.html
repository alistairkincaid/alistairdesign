                <h2>Tohu</h2>
                <p>This was a brief from Auckland Art Gallery to create a campaign to encourage more volunteer tour guides at the gallery.
                    Our target audience for this campaign was young art lovers who have excellent interpersonal skills. When starting this project we had much discussion around engaging with people to become volunteers without offering an incentive. The art gallery also has a high standard for their tour guides, so it was important to connect with indivduals with the right attributes and abilities.
                    <p>
                        In a team of three using a Holacracy group dynamic, we created a personality quiz as our solution. The quiz would compare the user to 1 of 5 famous New Zealand artists. The user would answer 10 personality questions such as &quot;romance or comedy?&quot; and answer by selecting the artist's paintings. It&apos;s natrual for humans to want to belong to a group. By comparing them to an artist such as Frances Hodgkins or Ralph Hotere they feel complemented and a part of the art community, encouraging them to look into volunteering as a guide at the Auckland Art Gallery.
                        <p>
                            My role as motion designer was to create an engaging motion piece that ran on social media platforms to lead people to the quiz. The video asks the question &quot;Which artist are you?&quot; It then does an infinity zoom through the 5 different worlds of the artist's personalities. I used a collage cut style of the imagery of the artist and as a team we created the painted assets, which I cut out and animated to bring these artists&apos; worlds to life. This quick fly through gives the audience a glimpse of which artists they could potentially be, motivating them to find out more.
